My main research interest is the application of quantitative text analysis and other big data methods in the political economy field. I employ a wide variety of methods in my research, particularly automated text analysis (and attached various machine learning approaches), network analysis and more traditional econometric techniques. I also happen to teach some of these in R as well. Most of my courses and workshops are open sourced and can be accessed via my GitHub page.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Education\r\n            2015 - 2019 | PhD, Political Science | Central European University\r\n            2016 - 2017 | Advanced Certificate, Network Science | Central European University\r\n            2014 - 2015 | MA, International Political Economy | Central European University\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Experience\r\n            2019 - Present | PoltextLAB | Research Fellow\r\n            2016 - Present | Data Science consultant | Freelance\r\n            2018 - Present |Instructor | European Consortium of Political Research\r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              Akos Mate\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      LinkedIn\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Twitter\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      GitHub\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              Bio\r\n              I am a computational social scientist doing research at the poltextLAB, Hungarian Academy of Sciences Centre of Excellence.
