## Bio

I am a computational social scientist doing research at the [poltextLAB](http://poltextlab.com/), Hungarian Academy of Sciences Centre of Excellence. My main research interest is the application of  quantitative text analysis and other big data methods in the political economy field. I employ a wide variety of methods in my research, particularly automated text analysis (and attached various machine learning approaches), network analysis and more traditional econometric techniques. I also happen to teach some of these in R as well. Most of my courses and workshops are open sourced and can be accessed via my GitHub page.
