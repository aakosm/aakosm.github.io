## Bio

I am a computational social scientist doing research at the [poltextLAB](http://poltextlab.com/) within Centre for Social Sciences, Budapest. I am also providing text analysis and data analysis consultancy to the International Monetary Fund's [Independent Evaluation Office](https://ieo.imf.org/). My main research interest is the application of quantitative text analysis and other big data methods in the political economy field. 

I employ a wide variety of methods in my research, particularly automated text analysis (and attached various machine learning approaches), network analysis and more traditional econometric techniques. I also happen to teach some of these in R as well. Most of my courses and workshops are open sourced and can be accessed via [my GitHub page](https://github.com/aakosm).
